## About

Tired of doing laborish and repetitive tasks over and over? Enter Cron, a tool to help you automate your tasks! Here we would see a demonstration on automating data collection and also monitoring our collection to clean the old ones.

## Technicals

### Dependencies

This example needs the following to be able to run, make sure your machine has the following things installed:
- Cron
- Python 3
- Bash

### Setup

After installing all of the dependencies in your machine, follow through these steps:

1. Lorem ipsum
2.  Dolro
3. Sit Amet

### Extension

This example could be extended to chain more tasks too! For example, we could print the message on our script and redirect them into a log filet. Put more info, such as the timestamp and summary, and it would become a more powerful tool for you to understand what's going on with the automation!
